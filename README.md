# File Encryption and Decryption

## üöÄ Overview
The **File Encryption and Decryption** project is a Python-based tool that securely encrypts and decrypts files using AES encryption in CBC mode. It generates a random encryption key, saves it to a file, and performs encryption or decryption based on user input.

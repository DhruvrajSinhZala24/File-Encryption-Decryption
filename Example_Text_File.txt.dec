This project is a File Encryption and Decryption Tool using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Python. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt files securely. The program generates a 256-bit AES key, saves it to a file, and uses CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode with a randomly generated IV (Initialization Vector) for encryption. It supports padding to handle file sizes that aren't multiples of the block size. Users can choose to encrypt or decrypt files by specifying the file name and the key file. The tool ensures secure data handling by saving the encrypted content with the IV and providing an option to load the key for decryption.
